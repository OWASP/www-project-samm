**Software Assurance Maturity Model**

Our mission is to provide an **effective and measurable** way for you to analyze and improve your **secure development lifecycle**. 
SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle and is **technology and process agnostic**. We built SAMM to be **evolutive and risk-driven** in nature, as there is no single recipe that works for all organizations.<br>
<br>

The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to
help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software
security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization.
SAMM helps you:

  - **Evaluate an organization’s existing software security practices**
  - **Build a balanced software security assurance program in
    well-defined iterations**
  - **Demonstrate concrete improvements to a security assurance
    program**
  - **Define and measure security-related activities throughout an
    organization**

*Dell uses OWASP’s Software Assurance Maturity Model (Owasp SAMM) to
help focus our resources and determine which components of our secure
application development program to prioritize.*, (**Michael J. Craigue,
