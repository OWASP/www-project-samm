The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to
help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software
security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization.
SAMM helps you:

  - **Evaluate an organization’s existing software security practices**
  - **Build a balanced software security assurance program in
    well-defined iterations**
  - **Demonstrate concrete improvements to a security assurance
    program**
  - **Define and measure security-related activities throughout an
    organization**

*Dell uses OWASP’s Software Assurance Maturity Model (Owasp SAMM) to
help focus our resources and determine which components of our secure
application development program to prioritize.*, (**Michael J. Craigue,
Information Security & Compliance, Dell, Inc.**)
