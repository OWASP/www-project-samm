**Software Assurance Maturity Model**

Our mission is to provide an effective and **measurable** way for all types of organizations to analyze and **improve their software security** posture. We want to **raise awareness and educate** organizations on how to design, develop, and deploy secure software through our [**self-assessment model**](https://owaspsamm.org/assessment/). SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle and is technology and process agnostic. We built SAMM to be **evolutive and risk-driven** in nature, as there is no single recipe that works for all organizations.

**SAMM V2 IS HERE!**

The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to
help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software
security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization.
SAMM helps you:

  - **Evaluate an organization’s existing software security practices**
  - **Build a balanced software security assurance program in
    well-defined iterations**
  - **Demonstrate concrete improvements to a security assurance
    program**
  - **Define and measure security-related activities throughout an
    organization**

*Dell uses OWASP’s Software Assurance Maturity Model (Owasp SAMM) to
help focus our resources and determine which components of our secure
application development program to prioritize.*, (**Michael J. Craigue,
